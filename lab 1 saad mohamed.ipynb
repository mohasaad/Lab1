      "This previous code block was built upon research by Presont and George as to which arcpy management string would work concerning the single operation of transferring one singular type of element into a new shape file. Specifically, if I was doing this in Arcmap, how would I accomplish this with a line or twenty of code?  The two gentlemen saved me a great deal of time experimenting with different _management commands and let me to Select by attribute. Which was near the bottom of my list and forsaken many times.  However, running in the python window was not enough as I had to secure the iPython worksapce to work well and reset the overwrite condition to allow me to run this in a sane fasion.  overwriting teh \"shapefile\" name each time allows me to run this script continually and resets at teh end. \n",

George and Prescott's use of the arcpy editor made me realize several mistakes earlier in my code concerning the worksapce I was using, and the assumpion that this entire code was running in H:\\Data\\saep_bg10_Saad when it was in fact running in \"H:\\Data\\saep_bg10_Saad/saep_bg10.dbf.
